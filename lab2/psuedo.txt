Make a grocery list
Need to take input from a file that has all of the data
When the program is run it should prompt user to input an item number or quit the program, this should happen everytime an input cycle is completed as well
Ask for item number, search through the program to see if the item number is valid or not
if it is valid then Take in the name of the item, the taxability, the sale type, and the price
if the item is taxable, add the tax to the price (probably need a new variable called total or sum)
if the sale type is n or p then ask how many, n, (int) or how many pounds, p, (float), multiply unit price by int n or float p; 
output the item number, item name, unit, unit price, tax, and subtotal
